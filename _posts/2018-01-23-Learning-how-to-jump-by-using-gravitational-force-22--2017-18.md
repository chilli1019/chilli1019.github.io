  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Try to use experiment by using gravity in Scratch. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To be able to use gravity to help create your own video game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes because in my bits of coding I could jump then be pulled back down by gravity.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I used persevering because when we were asked to try and figure out how to work on the gravity subject I had to keep trying before I could get it right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I used questioning because I had to question myself does this make sense and how could I expand this.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independence because I had to figure out myself in a way that my coding applied to the sprite would work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I used reflecting because I had to see where I went wrong and change that a bit to try and find the right answer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I used engagement because I got straight into the work when it was set and I was eager to do it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think what could have gone better in my learning was that I think I should have engaged and questioned a bit more because at one point in the lesson I didn't really understand how some of the coding worked however if I come in that situation again I realize I need to persevere and try to figure it out myself .</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think next time I should try and accomplish more because I felt like if I pushed myself a tiny bit more then I think I would understand what we were doing in the lesson more than just walking out feeling a bit confused and not getting what just happened.Also I think next time I should reflect a bit more so I do not make the same mistakes over again .</td>
