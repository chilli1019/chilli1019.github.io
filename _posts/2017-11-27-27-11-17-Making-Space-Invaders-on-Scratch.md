    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Attempting to create space invaders on Scratch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To be able to make and code my mothership and my bullet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes because I coded both my mothership and my bullet and created other sprites.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered because when my bullet wasn't coded right I had to find many different solutions before I found the right one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I used questioning because I questioned myself how to make something repeat on Scratch as I had never done it before.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independance because I worked out how to add a character from my file and use it on Scratch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I used reflecting because i wanted to make my coding better and more precise than last weeks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the lesson because when we got set to code I got engaged and I was listening to the lesson and following it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think in my learning what could have gone better was when I got something wrong I couldn't figure out what it was that I got wrong so wasted some time trying to figure it out when it was easy to work out. Also I think asking a couple of questions in the lesson if i'm confused instead of being confused and then not really following or getting what we are doing in the rest of the lesson.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think I should definitely get a bit more engaged in the lesson so after the lesson I don't walk out the lesson all confused but feel confident that I knew what we were doing in that lesson. Also I think that I should be more independent in my learning for an example of I am behind in the lesson I should try to figure things out myself instead of asking the person next to me for some help.</td>
