  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to persevere because when I did not complete a level I had to work it out.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question myself to ask myself if the coding was right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independance because this was an individual task and I had to figure things out by myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I had to reflect because I had to remember my code from scratch and use that to complete Blocky Games</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the lesson because I had to think what I could do and outcomes in the coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning I think what could have gone better was maybe if I tried to do more coding then I could try more challenging puzzles then I would feel way more confident when coding next time.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think I need to think it through more as I think I took to long on levels where I easily could have used my inititive more because then I could have got further and learnt even more.</td>
