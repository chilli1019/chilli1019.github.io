    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Finding out how to start a blog and code on JSBin.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Be able to use JS Bin and start our first blog.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes because i can now code on JSBin and also use it in different ways.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered because I did not know how to use JS Bin when we started ,but later on the lesson i found out.   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned myself because i asked myself how to use JSBin and also I asked myself how to do the coding on JSBin.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independance by figuring stuff out by myself (how to do coding and also how to start my first blog.)</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I really engaged in the lesson because when MR. Keen set us work I got stuck into it quickly and was following what i needed to do in the lesson.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that maybe working on my mistakes in the lesson because when I got a piece of coding wrong I couldn't  figure out which bit of the coding was wrong. Also I think I needed try a bit harder in the lesson so I could do more complicating coding which would be a good challenge for me. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Instead of asking Mr Keen straight away if i don't know something or couldn't do something I think I should persevere and find different ways including figuring something out for myself , maybe asking peers in the classroom to give me advice or even looking on a website if I got a piece of coding wrong and try and correct it myself. I also think I could reflect on my mistakes and errors a bit more . Finally I think i should write things down during the lesson as i'm normally getting confused.   </td>
