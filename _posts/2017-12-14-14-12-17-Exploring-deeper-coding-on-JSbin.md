<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>To be able to add a table and other effects through JSbin onto my Github website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>For your Github to have made progress by adding feature like a table .</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes because I added a table by using JSbin and W3schools (which really helped).</td>
  </tr>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I used persevering because when I did the coding for the table I had to figure out which line it would go on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I used questioning because I had to ask myself how to put the code into my coding on Github.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independance because I had to figure out how to add features onto my Github site.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I had to reflect because I had to use my knowledge from other pieces of coding and put them together so I could work out new things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the lesson because I was following what MR.Keen was doing which made the homework for me easier as I knew what I was doing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning what could have gone better was that I could have reflected more because I had lots of information so I knew what I was doing more If I reflected more.Also I think trying to do coding myself which hasn't been set but do more challenging work so I feel like I know what I am doing more.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think what I should do better is, is to try and push myself to the limits more so instead of doing the absolute  least which is required try and do more so that means I can understand the coding and what I am doing in the lesson more and thatâ€™ll mean i will walk out the classroom feeling confident.</td>
