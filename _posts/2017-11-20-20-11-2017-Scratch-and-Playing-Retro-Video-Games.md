  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I used perseverance because when I couldn't complete a level on         Chucky Egg I didn't give up but carried on persevering.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I used questioning because when I was behind in the lesson I questioned myself and asked myself is this coding right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independance because I worked out how to play the games using my initiative. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected because if I did badly in a game I would see what I could do to improve it .</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the lesson because I contributed to the lesson and was questioning and asking things. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my lesson I think I could have tried to push myself to really challenging coding and maybe even tried to change other things i had never done before. I also think maybe using my initiative even more and try and figure more things out for myself before asking the teacher (perseverance.) Finally I think doing extra stuff at home would definitely improve my coding skills and other skills.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think I  should definitely do some work at home like I said and maybe even push myself instead of doing the absolute least whilst doing my retro Video homework maybe push myself to do a few more and I will learn more things from it. Finally I think reflecting on things that I have done multiple of before to make it even better than how it was before.  </td>
