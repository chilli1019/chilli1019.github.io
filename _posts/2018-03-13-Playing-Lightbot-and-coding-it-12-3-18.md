  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered because when I got stuck on a level I kept trying to figure out a way to complete it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question myself because I had to ask myself how this would have the same kind of coding as last weeks one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independance because I was a different level to other people so I had to persevere.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I used reflecting because I had to think of last weeks coding and try and expand on that.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the lesson because I felt like I was doing well and working fast and was understanding the coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning what could have gone better was when I was coding in class I think I could have used my brain more and try to think if I was the person I am coding would the commands be accurate and precise enough.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think I should try more things and experiment even though I found a level really hard I think reflecting on it that could now be achievable also I think I should try and work quicker so I can  complete more and feel way more confident. </td>
