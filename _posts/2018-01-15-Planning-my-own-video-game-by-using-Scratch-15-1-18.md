  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I used persevering because when I was thinking of a game I had to keep trying to think of one to which of my ability I could achieve.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I used questioning because I had to ask myself if I would be capable to create the game I am planning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independance because I had to think of my own game and think what makes it unique.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I used reflecting because I reflected back to other video games to see what makes a video game good.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I used engagement because I had to engage in the lesson so I could think of some ideas on my game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning what could have gone better was questioning because if I maybe questioned myself even more then I maybe could have thought of another better idea because I would be questioning myself to see how I could include something in my game. Also I think persevering so instead of just suiting with the first idea for everything I could persevere more and think of more things. </td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think I should try and contribute and raise my hand in the lesson more because if I do not understand something I should not keep it to myself I should try and figure t out first and then once I have persevered and I can not work it out then ask the teacher for some help. Also I think I should follow the lesson as much as I can so i do not walk out the lesson confused.</td>
