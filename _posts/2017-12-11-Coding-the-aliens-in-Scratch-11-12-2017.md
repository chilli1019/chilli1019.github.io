    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>For by the end of this lesson to know how to control the aliens.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes because I knew how to code the aliens however I found it hard on the way.</td>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I used persevering because when we given a sheet to do for homework I found it very hard as it was sometimes incorrect so I had to persevere to find the code which was incorrect.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I used questioning because I had to ask myself which bit is correct and which bit isn't correct.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independance because when I had to finish off the sheet we were given in class I had to be independent in finding my own ways.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I used reflecting because I had to find which piece of coding was wrong then reflect on that and try and change it and make it right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the lesson because when we were set to do the sheet I just got on with it and tried to complete it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning I think what could have gone better is maybe get a bit more engaged so instead of walking out the classroom and worrying I could walk out the classroom and felt like I was really engaged in the lesson and I knew what we had to do. Also I think contributing to the lesson more because if I say something and get it wrong then I can learn from my mistakes and I'll get it right next time.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning next time I think that I should do some extra work at home more than homework then I can do more challenging coding of I get more experience. Also I believe next time to improve my learning I should push myself to the limits in class and try and do all the work and try and do even more if I finish.</td>
