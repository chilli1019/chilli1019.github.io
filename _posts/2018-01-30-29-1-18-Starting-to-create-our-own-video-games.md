  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>After planning our own video games we are now creating them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To get to a good place in the lesson so I know where to carry on from.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes because I started coding in the lesson which was a good start.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered because I had to keep trying to figure out code as I had never attempted to create my own video game before.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I used questioning because I had to ask myself if this happens then this could trigger something else to go or ask myself about what could happen next.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independance because I had to think of the ideas myself so I will create the game myself referring back to the plan.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected because I had to keep looking back at my previous projects to see how I could use my knowledge from them to add it in to my own game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the lesson because I was trying to get as much as I could done so it would be easy for me to carry on from there.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning what could have gone better was trying to complete more because then I would really know what I was doing and for the future it would be way easier to code my game if I was at a higher point of completing my game then having to catch up and spend longer on it for homework.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think I should think about when planning think to myself is this achievable so I do not make it to tricky or even do not make it to easy so I complete it in no time and it is really easy to play and be finished really easily.</td>
    <td></td>
