    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Attempting to code the mothership.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To be able to know how to make a sprite do various different things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes because I now know how to use different commands to control different sprites. </td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered because when we were set to code the mothership at home I  tried various different solutions before finding the right one. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I used questioning because I had to question myself and ask myself is this coding right so I could move onto greater things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independance because when I came home I had to figure out the rest of the coding myself instead of asking other people or Mr Keen for help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected because from last week's coding I had to reflect and see how I could develop the coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged because I got what were meant to do right away and I knew what we had to do for the rest of the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning I think what could have gone better is when he asks the people who are more confident to carry on or try and do it themselves I would like to be in that section soon so I can feel more confident in my learning. Also I think I could have been more independent in the lesson   because that means I can show that I do not need to ask any other students or my teacher to help me when i'm stuck.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning next time I would like to have a go at doing a challenge and trying to do it myself because then I can push myself even further and then iâ€™ll know the standard that I am. Also I think I should try and engage in the lesson a bit more so I don't walk out the lesson all confused because then if we get set homework or a task to do I can say to myself I know what we are doing.</td>
